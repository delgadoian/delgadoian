- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @delgadoian
  
I am a recent computer science graduate working as a help desk technician.
My interests include web dev, IT, Cybersecurity, and Python programming. Oh, and chess!

The programming languages I am most familiar with are C, Python, JavaScript, and a bit of Java.

I am currently refining my programming skills so that I can contribute to projects and build amazing web, mobile, and software applications!
